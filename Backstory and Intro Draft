The year is 3517. Mankind has colonized the galaxy. Now someone is beginning to colonize them.
Humanoid Scamians have discovered mankind's weakness: Dogma. Give a human being a little false hope, a few promises, and lots of impossible work to do, and they will gladly sacrifice their lives to fuel the Scamian armada.
But don't worry! It's not all bad. You too can have the mucous of sin washed from your soul and join the others in the Glorious System!*

*Celestial Brownies contingent upon good behavior.
